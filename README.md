# FoodTruck Application

# Description
	This program is designed to allow users to input and rate up to 5 food trucks. Once the trucks are entered in, the user is able to view the average rating of all trucks, view the highest-rated truck, or show all of the specific info related to a chosen truck. The program is separated into a FoodTruckApp class and a Foodtruck class that contains the specific truck info as well as the getters and setters.

#Lesson Learned
Through this process, I enhanced my understanding of object creation and how they are implemented with static fields in constructors. I also learned to better create a menu using a switch-case loop to prompt the user again each time. I learned how to use the toString, which allows the program to easily access the info for each truck. To create the "truck lot", I created an array, which needed each truck to be instantiated within it.
